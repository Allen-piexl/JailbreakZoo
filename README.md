# JailbreakingZooï¼šailbreakingZoo: Survey, Landscapes, and Horizons in Large Model Jailbreaking

## Introduction

Welcome to JailbreakingZoo, a dedicated repository focused on the jailbreaking of large models (LMs), encompassing both large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). This project aims to explore the vulnerabilities, exploit methods, and defense mechanisms associated with these advanced AI models. Our goal is to foster a deeper understanding and awareness of the security aspects surrounding large-scale AI systems.

## Contents

- [**Jailbreaks of LLMs**](https://github.com/Allen-piexl/JailbreakingZoo/blob/main/Papers/LLM_Jailbreak.md): Discover the techniques and case studies related to the jailbreaking of large language models.

- [**Defense of LLMs**](https://github.com/Allen-piexl/JailbreakingZoo/blob/main/Papers/LLM_Defense.md): Explore the strategies and methods employed to defend large language models against various types of attacks.

- [**Jailbreaks of VLMs**](https://github.com/Allen-piexl/JailbreakingZoo/blob/main/Papers/VLM_Jailbreak.md): Learn about the vulnerabilities and jailbreaking approaches specific to vision language models.
